									<h2> Introduction</h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										In this portfolio I showcase some of my major achievements so far, developing 
										a self designed city generator, NPC AI based on Utility Behavioural Trees, a 
										first person shooter game, and an implementation of projector effects; all 
										created using Unity 3D and Unreal game engines. C# and C++ are my main coding 
										languages but I can code with Python aswell. 
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: center">
										My enthusiasm for RPGs and their immersion mechanics has grown into a passion for 
										devloping and improving these systems in games. Been playing games since the 
										Playstation 1, but over time I experienced Xbox, Nintendo and PC gaming. At 16, I 
										created my first game which was a scrollable tank destroyer in c++ aided by SFML. 
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: center">
										I am in search of a stimulating and engaging work environment that allows me to foster 
										personal growth and enhance my skills. My aim is to contribute effectively to the company's 
										success, evolving into a more valuable asset for the organization.

									<p>
										Between 2020 and 2023 I studied Games Technology at <a href = "https://www.uwe.ac.uk"> 
										University of The West of England</a>. 
										I became educated in games development, studying games design theory, games programming
										and the use of developer programs like Autodesk Maya, Unreal, Unity, Visual Studio,
										Adobe Suite. As well as C#, C++ and Python. 
									</p>
									<h3 style = "text-align: left;">College</h3>
									<p>
										In college I studied computer science, maths, physics, and engineering. 
										I implemented my knowledge in these fields to recreate realistic physics 
										for my games development.

										<h2>Experiences</a></h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>
										At uni I worked within groups by being a part of multiple group orientated game jam based 
										tasks, taking a leadership role (for the games design module), and received 6 months of 
										exposure to a development studio environment when making a full PC and PS5 game as a cohort. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Covid deeply affected 2 years of my study at university. However, it provided an experience
										of working remotely to strict deadlines. I can now communicate efficiently and use multiple 
										types of communication programs, such as, Trello, Slack, Teams and Discord. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Being Polish myself and having experienced multiple cultures, such as spending 9 months in 
										Thailand. I'm excited to cooperate with diverse people and adapt my experiences into 
										interesting and unique game design ideas.
