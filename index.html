						<h1>Natan Dolny Portfolio<br />
						</h1>
						<p>
							Welcome to my portfolio showcase, featuring 5 of my central projects. I'm 
							<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natan-dolny/"> Natan</a> a games 
							programmer specialising in AI, procedural generation and immersion systems.
							I've been making games since 16 and playing them for much longer. This year 
							I graduated from <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk"> University of the West of 
							England</a>, 
							achieving a Second Class (Upper Division) in Games Technology. </p>
						<p>
							In this portfolio I showcase some of my major achievements so far, developing 
							a self designed city generator, NPC AI based on Utility Behavioural Trees, a 
							first person shooter game, and an implementation of projector effects; all 
							created using Unity 3D and Unreal game engines. C# and C++ are my main coding 
							languages but I can code with Python aswell.

										<h2>Background</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Playstation 1 was the first ever console I owned, but over time 
										I experienced Xbox, Nintendo and PC gaming. At 16, I created my 
										first game which was a scrollable tank destroyer in c++ aided by SFML. 
									</p>

										<h2>Aspirations</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I am in search of a stimulating and engaging work environment that allows me to foster 
										personal growth and enhance my skills. My aim is to contribute effectively to the company's 
										success, evolving into a more valuable asset for the organization.
									</p>

										<h2> Education</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In college I studied computer science, maths, physics, and engineering. 
										I implemented my knowledge in these fields to recreate realistic physics 
										for my games development. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Between 2020 and 2023 I studied Games Technology at <a href = "https://www.uwe.ac.uk"> UWE</a>. 
										I became educated in games development, studying games design theory, games programming
										and the use of developer programs like Autodesk Maya, Unreal, Unity, Visual Studio,
										Adobe Suite. As well as C#, C++ and Python. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Here I also became experienced in working within groups, playing a part in multiple group 
										orientated game jams based tasks, taking a leadership role (for the games design module), 
										and received 6 months of exposure to a development studio environment when making a full 
										game project as a cohort.
									</p>

										<h2>Experiences</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I thrive in group based work as I enjoy the multiple interactions stemming through it. 
										Being able to bounce off ideas, experience feedback, and earn the support and respect 
										of my peers feels very rewarding. It inspires me to achieve more and grow as an individual. 
										I find it deeply motivating.
									</p>
									<p>

										Being Polish myself and visiting many numerous countries, for example going to Thailand 3 
										times, I explored the diverse cultures of people with different ethnicities. I am open to all 
										types of people, and can adapt to them very quickly or learn from them.
									</p>
									<p>
										Covid deeply affected 2 years of my study at university too. However, it provided an experience
										of working remotely to strict deadlines. I can now communicate efficiently and use multiple 
										types of communication programs, such as, Trello, Slack, Teams and Discord.
